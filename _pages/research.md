## Convergence Guarantees of Diffusion Models
*Joint work with [Kexin Fu](https://openreview.net/profile?id=~Kexin_Fu2) and [Farzan Farnia](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/people/faculty/farzan-farnia/).* Oct. 2023 - Present.

Preprint: [On the Mode-Seeking Properties of Langevin Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02017)

- Formulated high-dimensional multi-modal distributions with an inter-mode component
- Theoretically studied the mode-seeking tendencies of Langevin dynamics
